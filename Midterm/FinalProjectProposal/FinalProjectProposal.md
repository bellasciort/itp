# Final Project Proposal
## By Bella Sciortino

What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Isabella Sciortino - Portfolio Website

In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")
My project will be a website showing my portfolio as an A&R.

List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project
I will use Python, Javascript, and textedit to assist in organization and completion. 

In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My website will be a multi-faceted website that shares my resume, visual pitch decks, A&R research, and achievements throughout my years at Berklee. Throughout my time at Berklee, the thought of creating a portfolio website was so intriguing and fun to me, but also incredibly nerve racking to me as I have no idea how to do that. I think having a website that displays the visual pitch decks I have made, where I have interned and consulted for, a photo of myself, my resume, something interactive and fun and different would be the direct goal. 

Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?
I do not think that this work will overlap with any classes, but it will be incredibly valuable when applying to music industry jobs. 

In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what? 

At the very least, I WILL make a website that has a cover page, and a drop down option that displays my works, achievements, and resume. 

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I will make a website that is interactive, and fun to navigate. 

In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I will create a website that has a cover page, and a drop down option that displays my works, achievements, and resume. It will also be interactive and fun to navigate and display my interests and show my personality.  

 In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
In April, the main goal is to build a strong foundation in web development by learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the core languages needed to create and style a personal website. To stay consistent, I will set aside at least 30 minutes each day to follow beginner-friendly tutorials on platforms like FreeCodeCamp, W3Schools, or Codecademy. During this month, I will also begin researching examples of portfolio websites—especially those focused on the music industry or creative business—to gather inspiration for myself. By the end of April, I aim to complete a few small practice projects, such as a personal bio page or a styled achievements section, to apply my learning and prepare for building my full site in the months ahead.
