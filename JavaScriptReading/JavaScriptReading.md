Chapter 1: 
One thing I did know what that bits were any kind of two-valued things usually described in zeros or numbers. We learned this as apart of our vocabulary in class last week. 
One thing I did not know was that strings are used to represent something; usually used by enclosing their content in quotes. 

Chapter 2: 
I honestly could not tell you that I knew anything before reading this chapter in good conscience.
One thing I did not know was that to get a program to remember things, we use binding. Binding can be used as an expression, and what determines the value of the expression is what we program it to bind to. 

Chapter 3: 
One thing I did know what that functions are used to have a parameters. We learned this in our Computer Apps class sophomore year. When using Excel, we used functions a lot.
One thing I did not know was that the place where the computer stores this contect of the function is called the call stack. Everytime the function is called, the current contaxt then stores on top of that stack.
