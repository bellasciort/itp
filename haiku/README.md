[Haiku](link)

I opened terminal
then I used pwd to ensure where I was
then used ls to cd documents 
from there I cd itp
I then was able to open the haiku subfolder 
from there I used the code to make my haiku.aiff but didn't properly use the code so i had to do it again 
then i was able to successfully make the aiff
then saved to the right place
