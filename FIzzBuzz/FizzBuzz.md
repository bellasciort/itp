# FizzBuzz

First, I opened my TextMate to create this file this way I would be able to record my homework, wrongdoings, and trouble shooting. 

I found this assignment to be a bit challenging, as I had not installed the proper installments in order to run the JavaScript function, so I did that first, and then went over again to re-do the code. 

I opened terminal, navigated myself to the correct directory (Documents) by saying "cd ~/Documents". 

Then I created a new file using nano and named it FizzBuzz.js

Then, I input this code: 
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("FizzBuzz");
  } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Buzz");
  } else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}

Then, I made sure to save it, and verified it was saved using the ls code. 

Then, we have to run the JavaScript file, and the code worked! I got all of the units!
