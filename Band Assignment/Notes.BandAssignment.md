First, we decided as a team that we wanted to be a Jazz trio, featuring a vocalist, bassist, and keys player. 

Then we put it into ChatGPT to make a bio for the band and each instrumentalist: 
come up with a short bio for a jazz band featuring keys, bass & vocals

ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Here's a set of short, stylish bios for each member that keeps the vibe cohesive but lets their personalities shine:

Alicia – Keys
The heartbeat of the trio, Alicia weaves harmony and emotion through every chord. With roots in both classical training and spontaneous improvisation, her playing brings depth, color, and a touch of magic to the group’s sound.

Daniel – Bass
Holding it down with smooth finesse, Daniel is the groove architect. Whether walking a line or exploring rich, melodic runs, his bass anchors the trio with warmth and soul, always in conversation with the music.

Bella – Vocals
Bella's voice is where jazz meets storytelling. With a tone that’s both smoky and sweet, she brings new life to timeless standards and original lyrics alike—each performance intimate, expressive, and deeply felt.

Then, we sent these to Alicia who started to program it into code for the website, during that time, I was making this, and Daniel was making a logo for our website. 

Brainstormed ideas for what else to put on the webiste, came up with a "Support Us!" venmo QR code tab. 

Then, we sent Alicia photos of us to put on the website as well. 

The assets we made sure to put onto the website was the photo/logo of the band, the band & artists bios, our venmo, and a link to our music/videos.
