# Sciortino Portfolio 
## Final Project Step by Step 

First, I created a new folder called "sciortino.portfolio" and then opened TextMate and started this log. 
Then I created a list to ensure I had all the materials that I wanted for my portfolio website which includes: resume, photo(s) of me, plans after graduation, and info for an "about me" section. 
Then, I opened p5 as well as our canvas to cross reference any codes that would be useful, and I started to code. 
I used the "CHEAT SHEET" for website building on Canvas and started my initial code. I wanted a white background, blue text for my title / name and black text for the rest!
