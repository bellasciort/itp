# Sciortino Portfolio 
## Final Project Step by Step

First, I created a new folder called "sciortino.portfolio" and then opened TextMate and started this log. 

Then I created a list to ensure I had all the materials that I wanted for my portfolio website which includes: resume, photo(s) of me, plans after graduation, and info for an "about me" section. 

Then, I opened GITHUB as well as our canvas to cross reference any codes that would be useful, and I started to code. 

I used the "CHEAT SHEET" for website building on Canvas and started my initial code. I wanted a white background, blue text for my title / name and black text for the rest! 
First, I made a new repository, then an html file on GitHub in order to create the intial website. I then was able to add all of the contents for the website through there. Using codes and help from the Canvas and class repository, I was able to make an initial code to create the website. Then I used notes from our in class band assignment to help create a sidebar section. 

From there, I added my resume, as well as a photo of the PULSE logo. 

I want to add a photo of myself about A&R club, so I will make sure to do that. 

After I added the two photos and campus involvement section, I was done! 

I just want to make it look more visually appealing. 

I made all of the header & subheader texts the same color.
